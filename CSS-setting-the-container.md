##  Using the container.

Put all the elements inside a container and set the container like this

Steps:

   
   2. Make the container centered 

```
.container {
  Step 1: Set width of the container
   width: 1140px;
  Step 2: Make the DIV centered. auto means that the left and right margin are adjusted automatically according to the context of the           element which is the browser window. So if you adjust the browser window the content stays centered.
   margin-left: auto;  
   margin-right: auto;
}
```
