The desire should already exist – Page 11
Every new advertisement should be fresh new problem that never existed on the face of this earth.
Copy cannot create desire for the product. Your copy could only focus the existing desires onto that particular product. In other words a copy writer should channel the existing desire onto that particular product.  – Page 19. Read an example on page 20. What happens when you create an ad against the mass desire?
Desire is nothing but a private want.
We should only address our ads to individuals – Page 20
If a private desire is shared by a statistically significant number of people a market is born. – Page 21
All these private wants take years to develop, and they are created b\ social, economic and technological forces. Page 21
Simply direct this mass existing desire or economic force onto the product. When you try to create that desire it is no longer advertising but education.
A copywriters job is to create a fresh appeal and to build a stronger believability to the product he is advertising. – Page 22
A copywriter offers the same claim of relief as his competitors but in a different way.
A copywriter should stress any appeal that are built into that product. He should stress the same in his copy writing.
Thus a copywriters job is to detect the mass existing desire and change their force and direction.
Every desire has 3 vital dimensions – urgency, intensity, degree of demand to be satisfied and you use the most powerful desire in all three dimensions as your headline. Your job is to provide satisfaction to that desire in a single statement. – Page 24
All customers can be classified in to three types.  Page 24
– People who are aware of your product and realizes it can satisfy their desire – in this case headline starts               with the product
– People who are aware of your product, but only of the desire – here your headline starts with desire
– People who are not aware of really what he seeks but is only concerned with a general problem – your                   headline starts with the problem and crystallizes into a specific need.
To satisfy the desire, mention only the functional aspect of the product – the product in action – the series of benefits that your product performs for your consumer and on the basis of which he buys your product. Do not mention the physical aspect of the product eg. steel in car, the glass in a vase, the tobacco in a cigarette, or the paper in a book.  – Page 25
Your product, in order to pull sales away from them, must introduce a new mechanism that performs the claim, or a new quality that assures its performance, or a new freedom from old limitations that improves the performance.Examples:

1. Our TV has more tubes in the television set
2. The more stitches per inch in the suit
3. The weight of steel in your car’s door, and he’s more likely to believe that your car will protect his life if  he should have an accident on the highway.
4. Tell Your prospect the number of times your plant removes the impurities in your face cream, and she’s more likely to believe that your cream will remove the impurities in her skin.
5. Chemically protected paper means you can hand your prize books down to your children.
6. Quick-frozen food means you can retain taste and vitamins for months after your purchase.
7. The Rolls-Royce must give you perfect riding silence because every metal part of the chassis is shielded from every other metal part by a protective coat of rubber.
8. Helena Rubinstein’s new face cream must make your skin look younger because it contains the placenta of living animals.
17. Your product, in order to pull sales away from them, must introduce a new mechanism that performs
the claim, or a new quality that assures its performance, or a new freedom from old limitations that improves the performance. This is the point of difference – Page 26

## Chapter 2

1. Your ad always begins with your market, and leads that market inevitably into your product. So say you are advertising on autotrader.com, autotrader.com is the market and it should lead to your product. In this case you will have to write your ad based on the below questions

               1. What is the mass desire that creates this market? (Which we have already discovered.)
               2. How much do these people know today about the way your product satisfies this desire? (Their State of Awareness.)
               3. How many other products have been presented to them before yours? (Their State of Sophistication.)

When you advertised on toysrus.com there was a mass desire for hatchimals and that was the reason it got sold. I guess many where aware of hatchimals. Their state of sophistication is                      very less since not many would have advertised that product to them.

2. Actually, your headline does not need to sell at all. It does not have to mention your product.Your headline has only one job—to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad. In exactly the same way, your second sentence has only one job—to force him to read the third sentence of Your ad. – Page 30

3. It is simply common sense that the more of your story you can force your prospect to read, the more thoroughly you can sell him. It is the copy writer’s job to force the prospect to read his client’s full story—not just a skimmed version of it. To attempt a complete selling job with only a headline, is simply to admit defeat – This also says an advertorial kind of page would be good.

4. Identifying your prospects state of awareness. Ask these questions to identify them.

1. How much is your prospect aware of his desire?
         2. How close is it to the surface of his consciousness?
         3. Is he aware only that a problem or need exists?
         4. Is he aware if they can be satisfied?
         5. If he is aware that a means of satisfaction exists, does he realize that it lies in your group of                    products specifically in your product by name or more specifically in your product at a given                price?

The answer to these questions will help you determine the State of Awareness of your market—their present                  state of knowledge about your product and the satisfaction that your product performs. It is at this precise point          of awareness that your headline begins.

 The more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the less you need to say.

1.  The Most Aware:

The customer knows of your product—knows what it does—knows he wants it. At this point, he just hasn’t                    gotten around to buying it yet. Your headline—in fact, your entire ad—need state little more except the name                of your product and a bargain price. For example:

“Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eve Camera—Formerly $149.50—Now Only $119.95.”

There is nothing creative about his job, and he should receive the lowest possible scale of pav.

2. The Customer Knows of the Product But Doesn’t Yet Want It

Case 1:

A good example would be many customers knows about submersible pumps and wants it. The prospect searches it in Google just as “submersible pumps” and not as “C.R.I submersible pumps”. When we wrote ad copy as “C.R.I Submersible pumps” and showed it to these prospects who searched as “submersible pumps” they did not react well to the ad copy.

Case 2:

When I ran PPV ads as “Get Free hatchimals” for people who were visiting toysrus.com these prospects reacted to the ad copy.

Now the above scenarios suggest the below mentioned rule

Your ad always begins with your market, and leads that market inevitably into your product. 

A better explanation to support the above statement:

People are searching for autotrader.com mainly for searching “used cars”. Your responsibility as an advertiser would be to show these prospects used cars and lead that market inevitably into your product. So show them used cars and pull them to car loan. I tried showing these prospects(autotrader.com) “car loan” but unfortunately I got no conversions.

Now look at this site, jeremysaysyes.com he shows a list of old cars and when someone clicks the details it goes to another page and there is a hyperlink “GET APPROVED NOW”, now this inturn links to the affiliate URL.

So in this case when a prospect searches for “submersible pumps”, your ad should only speak about submersible pumps and lead that prospect to “CRI submersible pumps”.

How can this be done is what we are going to look here.

Here your headline is faced with one of seven tasks:

1. To reinforce your prospects desire for your product: 

  Example ads:

“Hair Coloring So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure—Miss Clairol.” It starts with hair coloring explains why it is better and then leads to the brand which is Miss Clairol.

“Tastes like you just picked it—Dole.”
“The skin YOU love to touch—Woodbury”

2. To sharpen his image of the way your product satisfies that desire;

“At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royee is the electric clock.”
“The amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the bellv of a fish.”

3. To extend his image of where and when your product satisfies that desire;

“Thirst knows no season”—in a winter ad, at a time when cold drinks were only consumed during the summer—”
Coca Cola.”

4. To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your product satisfies that desire;

     “9 out of 10 screen stars use Lux Toilet Soap for their priceless smooth skins.”
“In Boston, the #1 tea-drinking citv, the #1 tea is Salada.”

5. To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire e\-en better;

“Hoovers new invention washes floors and vacuums up the scrub water.”
“Worlds only dog food that makes its own gravy—Gaines Graw Train.”

6. To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates former limitations;

“A new Zenith hearing aid—inconspicuous beyond belief.”

In all the above cases (explain why your used cars is better, explain why your submersible pumps is better and remember your ad should speak about what your prospect searches and lead that prospect to your product. Speak about used cars and to get that car you should apply for auto loan.

In all seven cases, the approach is the same. You display the name of the product—either in the headline or in an equally large logo—and use the remainder of the headline to point out its superiority. The body of the ad is then an elaboration of that superiority—including visualization, documentation, mechanization. When you have finished weaving in every strand of your product’s superiority, your ad is done. – Page 33

7. Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of that product, in order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire.

Now here in this case, prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn’t yet know’ that there is a product—your product—that will do it for him

Example: He knows about submersible pumps but he does not know about C.R.I submersible pumps. So here he recognizes immediately that he wants what the product does; but he doesn’t yet know’ that your product will do it for him.

 So what should be done in this case?

Now the above desire is called amorphous desire. Amorphous desires means a desire without a clearly defined shape or form.

If the desire is amorphous you will have to find 3 attributes and they are as follows

Analysis: Identify the driving emotional forces that have created both that market and the potential for the sales of your product within it.
Intuition: Identify the trend at its start, gauge its force and direction and determine the precise moment when it boom or skyrocket into a profitable market.
Verbal creativity: The ability to give a name to the still-undefined market.
examples on how amorphous desire has been crystallized in the headline.

“Now! Run your car without spark plugs”
“Who ever heard of 17,000 />/<>om* ironi a single plant0″

Sometimes desire itself must be reinforced by fresh proof that it can be achieved, ”

20,679* physicians say “LUCKIES are less irritating”
